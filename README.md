Too munch to handle

To run, make sure you have expo installed, along with: 
- npm install @react-navigation/native
- npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
- npm install @react-navigation/stack
- npx expo install react-native-gesture-handler

Once the requirements are installed, run 
- npx expo start (or "npx expo start --tunnel" if you are on public wifi)
